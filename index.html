        <p class="lead mb-4">  My name is Longlong Xiao, I am currently a sophomore at undeclared major in UCR. I came to US in 2015, and I was graduated from Cantwell Sacred Heart of Mary high school in LA. During my high school, I went to UCLA to engage with its summer program during my sophomore year in high school. During my senior year, I was a volunteer in a church to take care of the disabilities. In my college, I invested a restaurant in order to learn more experience about management. From those past experience, I had learned a lot from it, those experiences also makes me improve in both personalities and knowledge.
  During the summer after my sophomore year, I went to a summer program in UCLA called MUN. In the Model United Nations summer program, I represented China. Our program was in the time of WWII and we discussed Italyâ€™s invasion of Abyssinia (now Ethiopia). I saw similarities between the Abyssinian conflict and Chinaâ€™s relationship to Japan. Just like Italy, Japan invaded China, breaking their contract and leaving the League of Nations. The League did not do enough to stop Italy, which is how they handled the invasion of China. I decided to send troops to help protect Abyssinia, hoping we would have help later if Japan invaded China.
  The most important lesson that I learned from MUN is constructionism, when someone creates an idea and it becomes a version of history. Constructionism blurs the truth until it does not exist. I wonder how much of the truth I know, since I canâ€™t relive the past. Now, I have the confidence to question history out loud, even though English is my second language. At MUN I grew in my understanding of the world.
  When I was young, my parents took me to a lots of social activities in order to learn the ability of socializing with others, that is why after I grow up, I know more about the complex relationship between people, and I know that many people have other sides that nobody knows. Even with this experience, I still want to understand different peopleâ€™s lifestyle, and improve my capabilities to every kind of people, so I decided to volunteered at a disabilitiesâ€™ church which is called Milal. 
Taking care of people with disabilities at Milal, because even though I am a volunteer, I feel like I am a part of the family there. The students want a community, people who love them, and can listen to them. Even though they canâ€™t say all of their feelings, I try to comprehend them.
  I am a slow starter, so the first impression I gave to you will not be the true me. From the learning experience in the past, I understand that most people have the same feelings and I feel after those experiences, I can embrace the difference of each different person as well as each different culture. I appreciate those past experiences which brings me development and as well as the life experiences which will makes me a better person in the future.
